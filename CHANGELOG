Developer
---------

Breaking changes:

* Model: If a column of a 'dataset' contains HTML, you must also set 'isSafeHtml' => true if you don't want that it to be encoded (for security reasons).
* CRUD: For item updating, the callback function 'success' is called after 'save' (not before), like for creating.
* Attachment: Methods ->url() and ->urlResized() return absolute URLs. They accept an optional parameter for the return of relative URLs.
* Comments: Comments are now contextable. Migration tries to guess context of existing comments, but if you've implement comments on a not contextable model, migration can't do nothing: set yourself context if you want to see those comments in new administration interface.
* Blog/News: Thumbnail is now configurable (size & link).
    * Default thumbnail size changed from 200 everywhere to 120 in the listing and 200 on the item.
